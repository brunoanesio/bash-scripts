# Bash Scripts

Some bash scripts that I occasionally use.

## Screenshot script

Script that uses [_maim_](https://github.com/naelstrof/maim) to take a screenshot. Can select a region/window or full screen. Output will also be copied to clipboard.

Usage:

```bash
screenshot.sh select
```

## Picom scripts

Scripts to start and kill _picom_ easily. Useful to disable _picom_ when starting a game and restart it after exiting a game.

Usage:

Use in _Lutris_ pre and post launch scripts.
